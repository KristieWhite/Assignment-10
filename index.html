            <li><h2 id="dachshund">Dachshund-Beagle (Doxle)</h2><p class="hide1">The Doxle is not a purebred dog. It is a cross between the Beagle and the Dachshund. The best way to determine the temperament of a mixed breed is to look up all breeds in the cross and know you can get any combination of any of the characteristics found in either breed. Not all of these designer hybrid dogs being bred are 50% purebred to 50% purebred. It is very common for breeders to breed multi-generation crosses.</p></li>
            
            <li><h2 id="cavalier">Cavalier King Charles Spaniel</h2><p class="hide2">The cavalier in many ways fits the bill as an ideal house pet. He is sweet, gentle, playful, willing to please, affectionate and quiet. He is amiable toward other dogs, pets and strangers. Outdoors, his spaniel heritage kicks in, and he loves to explore, sniff and chase.</p>
            <p class="hide2">The cavalier needs a fair amount of exercise every day, either in the form of a moderate walk on leash or a romp in a safe area. This is not a breed that should live outdoors. His long coat needs brushing every other day.</p></li>
            
            <li><h2 id="bombay">Bombay Cat</h2><p class="hide3">If an aloof, independent cat is what you're craving, this breed isn't for you. Bombays are attached to their family, and tend to love the entire family rather than bond with only one person. Fanciers say they are particularly good with children.
